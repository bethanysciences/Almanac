## Time Functions

Grabbed from Adafruit's battery backed I2C Maxim DS3231 Real Time Clock (RTC) [module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3013) using Adafruit's [library](https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib) a fork of JeeLab's ][library](https://git.jeelabs.org/jcw/rtclib). - install from Arduino IDE as 'RTClib'.

## Tide Events

Calculated using [Luke Miller's library](https://github.com/millerlp/Tide_calculator) of NOAA harmonic data derived from [David Flater's XTide application](https://flaterco.com/xtide/xtide.html). Futher logic is derived from [rabbitcreek's](https://github.com/rabbitcreek/tinytideclock) code.

## Sun Events

Calculated using [SunEvents library](https://github.com/bethanysciences/SunEvents) outputting sunrises and sets to a RTClib DateTime object, a derivative of [DM Kishi's library](https://github.com/dmkishi/Dusk2Dawn), based on a port of [NOAA's Solar Calculator](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/).

Output to serial for test and tweaking.

Includes eamples outputting to OLED and seven-segment displays.
